# Everyday I Get Emails
A virtual representation of my stress.

Everyday I get emails. Every week my professors keep assignming more projects. Why? Just to make me suffer? I have too much to do and I've had enough. 

This is a virtual representation of my stress. All the tasks that I need to swirl around my head as I sit at my desk and attempt to work. I can try to get away from the cloud of words that creates my daily brain fog, but there is no escape: it simply follows me around. 

## Instructions
1. Run the Processing file and open to-do.txt.
2. Adjust the threshold so that the words in the .txt file appear over your head. This can be done by moving the mouse inside the Processing window up or down.
3. To change the words, type in the .txt file and then save it. The adjustment will slowly appear in the Processing window. 

## Notes
* Although the threshold can be adjusted to your needs, the program runs best when the user sits in front of a white, well lit background. 
* To adjust the webcam input, see the list of cameras printed in the Processing IDE. To select a camera, put its list number into "inputs[x]" for x in line 39.
